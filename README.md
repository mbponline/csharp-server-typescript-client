﻿CSharp server Typescript client - Experiment
==========================================

This project try to simplify the web development and prototyping for Single Page Applications over existing databases.
The project contains two components, the **Client** and the **Server** which communicate over *HTTP* using a very simple protocol to query the data. This query protocol cover usual cases when it is needed to retrieve data from database. For more complex queries it is needed to  write the necessary code on the server and expose the data as a service operation.
